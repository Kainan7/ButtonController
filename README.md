This code is an example of how to use an ESP32 as a Bluetooth (BLE) keyboard to control a game. The ESP32 is configured to communicate as a BLE keyboard and sends simulated keyboard 
commands based on the physical buttons connected to it.

The code defines constants for the physical button pins (left, right, up and down), configures BLE communication and implements button press detection logic.

All of this was for the AV2 test for the college's prototype experimentation course.
